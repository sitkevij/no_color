# no_color

**no_color** is a rust library for detecting if the NO_COLOR environment variable is set.

## About

From [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/):

An increasing number of command-line software programs output text with ANSI color escape codes by default. While some developers and users obviously prefer seeing these colors, many users donâ€™t. Unfortunately, every new piece of software seems to have a different way of disabling colored text output and some software has no way at all.

Accepting the futility of trying to reverse this trend, an informal standard is hereby proposed:

> All command-line software which outputs text with ANSI color added should check for the presence of a NO_COLOR environment variable that, when present (regardless of its value), prevents the addition of ANSI color.

By adopting this standard, users that prefer to have plain, non-colored text output can set one environment variable in their shell to have it automatically affect all supported software.

## Usage

no_color is a library crate which works with [Cargo](http://crates.io).

### Add to Cargo.toml

To use, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies section:

```toml
[dependencies]
no_color = "0.1"
```

### Implementing Code

Suggested updates to your rust code as below:

- Note for edition 2018 [extern is not needed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/module-system/path-clarity.html) to import a crate.

- See [examples/simple.rs](examples/simple.rs) for reference.

```rust
extern crate no_color;

use no_color::*;

fn main() {
    if is_no_color() {
        println!("{0}", "Not ok to print color terminal chars");
    } else {
        println!("{0}", "Ok to print color terminal chars");
    }
}

```
